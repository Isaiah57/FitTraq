# FitTraq
A personal project I'm working on that's about 75% finished.

If you find anything that's incorrect, please feel free to give criticism and show me the error of my ways.

End goal of this project is to have an application that can do OCR on nutritional value labels and/or have the user be able to input those
values themselves. 

Please excuse any bad coding practices, I started this project without knowing anything about app development and what's currently shown was made in about 2 days.
